Python is a high level language used for web design and so on.<br/>
The main secret to python is to read it like you read english cause its very easy to use<br/>
-Python has basic data types like most well known languages <br/>
Float<br/>
NUmbers<br/>
Int<br/>
Etc<br/>
There are two types of naming such as <br/>
#Snake method
#Elephant method
We use the print('') to out put anything<br/>
And input() to take an input and store it in a var<br/>
#f string lets you format your datatype 
and sep= to separate outputs<br/>
EX name=input('enter name')<br/>
We use # to comment<br/>
#conditions<br/>
if (condition):<br/>
statement;<br/>
elif():<br/>
statement<br/>
res=restrictions<br/>
#Sequence<br/>

list_of_numbers=[1,2,3,4,5]#list is an orderd sequence of an iteam most used as datatype <br/>
print(len(list_of_numbers))#length returns lenght of values<br/>
print(list_of_numbers [2:4])#gives you the number in between =Slicing<br/>
print(list_of_numbers.append(25))#apend used to add a list to the existing list <br/>

name='hana'<br/>
print(name[-1])reverse access <br/>
tuple = (1,2,3,4,5)#can not be modified/immutable like a list could be but has the same job <br/>
set= {1,2,3,4,4,5}#holds uniqe value and is unordered list and not repeatable <br/>
print(type(set))<br/>
Dict-dictionary holds key+ value<br/>
number_dict={'name':'alex','age':22,'gender':'male'}<br/>
Dict-dictionary holds key+ value<br/>
#  .append - to append values<br/>
# .insert( index to be inserted to , value)<br/>
# for loop<br/>
For var in list (like i said, just read it like english)<br/>
#zip- to grab or hold two sets<br/>
