In javascript We learned how to setup javascript wihich is internally using script tag or externally with .js extenesion.<br/>
# Javascript is case sensitive<br/>
# We can comment in JS either using <br/>

//  for  Single Line Comments<br/>
/* */  for Multi-line Comments<br/>
 
 
 Variables<br/>
 We use Var, let and const to declare variables.Const cant be reassigned once its declared unlike the others.<br/>
 
 Rules for Naming JavaScript Variables<br/>
 
 Variable names must start with either a letter, an underscore _, or the dollar sign $.<br/>
 Variable names cannot start with numbers<br/>
  JavaScript is case-sensitive. So y and Y are different variables.<br/>
  Keywords cannot be used as variable names.<br/>
  
  We also saw Javascript data types and operators <br/>
  
  Js operators are the basics such as <br/>
  Arithmetic operators - +,*,-,/<br/>
  Assignment operators - =,+=,*=,-=,/=<br/>
  String operators - +, += <br/>
   Incrementing and Decrementing Operators - ++x,++x<br/>
   Logical Operators - && , !<br/> and so
